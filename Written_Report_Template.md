# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to provide data to Louise on the fundraising for all of the plays. Louise noticed the play Fever was close to reaching the goal in a short period of time and wanted to see if the other plays were successful/failed in reaching the goal or if they plays were completely cancelled.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For Outcomes Based on Goal I performed my analysis by seperating successful and failed outcomes into different sheets. I was unable to locate cancelled outcomes. I then created another sheet for the goal ranges. When calculating the successful and failed outcomes I switched back and forth between sheets to gain the correct columns and sheet name for the Outcomes Based on Goals sheet.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

[Outcomes Based on Goals for Fundraisers](https://github.com/analystwil/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png?raw=true)

For Theater Outcomes by Launch Date I crated a pivot table and line graph based off of every month to to see the campaign outcomes by launch month. I narrowed the results down based on Parent Category to generate the appropriate date for the pivot table.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I ran into a challenge when using the COUNTIFS code. I spent almost two days trying to figure out what the issue was. I then noticed I had the incorrect columns selected, the goal was entered incorrectly and when I went to generate the percentage I was getting abnormally high percentages that were incorrect. I watched a few YouTube videos to find the solution and broken the code down into sections to narrow down the incorrect placements of the columns.

## Results

## What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

I can conclude that the most successful months are May and June. I assume during the warmer months people are more open to going to fundraising events

## What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

I conclude that the higher the fundraising goal is the greater chance it will fail. The most successful goal that has been reached is less than $1,000.

## What are some limitations of this dataset

I would say the limitations of this data set would be we donâ€™t know exactly how many people gave specific amounts of money. I think having that information would allow us to see if possibly the goal should be adjusted based off how many people are giving a specific amount to each play.

## What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could create a pivot table and bar graph to see how much is raised by the year and month and exactly how much each person is giving to the specific play.
